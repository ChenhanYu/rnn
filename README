GSRNN (General Stride R-Nearest Neighbor)
README
---

Thank you for deciding to give GSRNN a try!
This code can be used for exact R-Nearest Neighbor search.

See INSTALL on how to install it.

Nearest Neighbor search appears in machine learning, manifold 
learning and other scientific computing problems.

GSRNN (General Stride R-Nearest Neighbor) is a portable framework that
provides a high performance memory efficient nearest neighbors search 
based on the BLIS framework.

GSRNN has several features. For further details of this project, please
check the Githup repo:

Thank you again for being intersted in GSRNN!

Best regards,
