GSRNN (General Stride R-Nearest Neighbor)
Install
---

The simplest way (the only way) to install GSRNN is to use makefile.

>source set_env.sh
>make

GSRNN requires c and c++ compilers that support OpenMP, and the
default micro-kernel (written AXV) requires the a Sandy-Bridge
processor or any successor.

The currnet reference function requires the support of the MKL
library which will be changed in the future. The default 
compilation will also compile all the testing drivers. To run
some basic examples from the testing drivers:

>cd test
>./run_dgsrnn.sh

To embed GSRNN in a specific application, you need to include the
header files <rnn.h> and make the right function calls. 
GSRNN can be linked statically with lib/librnn.a.

C/C++ example:
...
#include <rnn.h>
...

Compilation example:
>gcc ... -I$(RNN_DIR)/include $(RNN_DIR)/lib/librnn.a
